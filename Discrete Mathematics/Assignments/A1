1. What are the negations of the following propositions?
  a) Juan and Pedro are friends.
    Juan and Pedro are not friends.
  
  b) There are 15 items in the fridge.
    There are not 15 items in the fridge.

  c) Liz sent over 200 emails yesterday.
    Liz did not send more than 200 emails yesterday.

  d) 169 is a perfect square.
    169 is not a perfect square.
  
2. Determine if each of these conditional statements is true or false:  
  a) If 1 + 1 = 2, then Griffins exist.
    p: 1 + 1 = 2
    q: Griffins exist.
    (If p, then q = p → q)
    p = true
    q = False
    In implications, if the antecedent or premise (p) is True, but the consequence (q) is False, then the final result ends up being *False*.

  b) If 3 + 1 = 5, then rhinos fly.
    p: 3 + 1 = 5
    q: Rhinos fly.
    (If p, then q = p → q)
    p = false (3 + 1 ≠ 5 // 3 + 1 = 4)
    q = false (Rhinos cannot flight.)
    In Implications, if both propositions are false, the final result ends up being *True*.
  
  c) If 2 + 6 = 2, then cats fly.
    p: 2 + 6 = 2
    q: Cats fly
    (If p, then q = p → q)
    p = false (2 + 6 ≠ 2 // 2 + 6 = 8)
    q = false (Cats do not have the property of flying.)
    In Implications, if both propositions are false, the final result ends up being *True*.
  
  d) If 3 + 3 = 4, then 4 + 7 = 11.
    p: 3 + 3 = 4
    q: 4 + 7 = 11
    (If p, then q = p → q)
    p = false (3 + 3 ≠ 4 // 3 + 3 = 6)
    q = true (4 + 7 = 11)
    In implications, if the antecedent or premise (p) is false, but the consequence (q) is true, then the final result ends up being *True*. 
  
3. State the converse, contrapositive, and inverse of each of these conditional statements:
  a) If it snows tonight, I'll stay home.
    p: It snows tonight.
    q: I'll stay home.
    Reciprocal (Order Exchange): If I stayed home, then it's snowing tonight.
    Inverse (negation): If it doesn't snow tonight, then I won't stay home.
    Contrapositive (Exchange order and denial): If I didn't stay home, then it didn't snow tonight.

  b) I go to the beach every time it's a sunny summer day.
    whenever = whenever // q whenever p
    p: It is a sunny summer day.
    q: I'm going to the beach.
    Reciprocal (Order Exchange): It's a sunny summer day every time I go to the beach.
    Reverse (negation): I don't go to the beach every time it's not a sunny summer day.
    Contrapositive (Exchange order and negation): It's not a sunny summer day every time I don't go to the beach.

  c) When I stay up late, it is necessary for me to sleep until noon.
    When = If p, q
    p: I stay up late.
    q: You need to sleep until noon.
    Reciprocal (Exchange Order): If I need to sleep until noon, then I stay up late.
    Inverse (negation): When I don't stay up late, I don't need to sleep until noon.
    Contrapositive (Exchange order and denial): If I don't need to sleep until noon, then I don't stay up late.
    
4. How many rows appear in a truth table for each of these compound statements?
  a) (q → ¬p) ∨ (¬p → ¬q)
    (p,q) = 2^2 = 4 rows.
  
  b) (p ∨ ¬r) ∧ (p ∨ ¬s)
    (p,r,s) = 2^3 = 8 rows.
    
  c) (p → r) ∨ (¬s → ¬t) ∨ (¬u → v)
    (p,r,s,t,u,v) = 2^6 = 64 rows.

  d) (p ∧ r ∧ s) ∨ (q ∧ t) ∨ (r ∧ ¬t)
    (p,q,r,s,t) = 2^5 = 32 rows.
