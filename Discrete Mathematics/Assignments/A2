1. For each of the following compound statements, use conditional-disjunctive 
equivalence to find an equivalent compound statement that does not involve conditionals:
  a) ¬p → ¬q
    ¬¬p v ¬q
     p v ¬q

  b) (p → q) → r
  ¬(p ∧ q) ∨ r
  (p ∧ ¬q) v r

2. Show that each of the following conditional statements are tautologies:
  a) (p ∧ q) → p
    
    p | q | p ∧ q | (p ∧ q) → p 
   t  | t  |   t   |      t    |    
   t  | f  |   f   |      t    |       
   f  | t  |   f   |      t    |    
   f  | f  |   f   |      t    |    
   
  b) ¬p → (p → q)
    
  p | q | p → q | ¬p | ¬p → (p → q) 
  t | t |   t   |  f |       t
  t | f |   f   |  f |       t
  f | t |   t   |  t |       t
  f | f |   t   |  t |       t
